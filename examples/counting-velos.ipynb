    "# Counting velos with Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "A [notebook](https://opendata.utou.ch/presentations/pyzurich%202014.9/) was presented a few years back by [@loleg](http://github.com/loleg) at a [PyZürich meetup](http://www.meetup.com/pyzurich/events/192324292/), serving a brief introduction to loading and processing open data with the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) open source data analysis library. The second part of this notebook dealt with visualizing government data from bike counters *(Daten der permanenten Velozählstellen)*. The analysis is heavily inspired by prior work by [Dr. Ralph Straumann](http://geo.ebp.ch/2014/02/18/blick-in-die-werkzeugkiste-offene-daten-in-r-teil1/) (see also [part 2](http://geo.ebp.ch/2014/04/04/blick-in-die-werkzeugkiste-offene-daten-in-r-teil-2/), [part 3](http://geo.ebp.ch/2014/04/25/blick-in-die-werkzeugkiste-offene-daten-in-r-teil-3/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mobility is a popular subject in Switzerland, and the data source continues to be a source of interest I have rewritten the example using the [Julia language](http://julialang.org/). To run this notebook interactively, install Julia locally and follow the instructions at [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) to set up a notebook server. Or use [JuliaBox](http://www.juliabox.com) to run this code in the cloud.\n",

    "So let's get started and pull in some useful libraries."
